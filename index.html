        <p>To protect human health: This is the most important goal of environmental protection because<br>
           humans cannot survive without a healthy environment. To protect ecosystems: Ecosystems are the <br>
           foundation of life on Earth, and they provide many benefits to humans, such as clean air and water,food, and fiber.

    <h2>TYPES OF ENVIRONMENT :-</h2>
    <img src="types.png" alt="TYPES OF ENVIRONMENT"/>
    <p>The four ecosystem types are classifications known as:-<br>
      <ol type="1"></ol> 
      <li>Artificial Ecosystem</li> 
      <li>Terrestrial Ecosystem</li>
      <li>Lentic Ecosystem</li>
      <li>Lotic Ecosystem</li>
      </p>Ecosystem are parts of biomes, which are climatic systems of life and organisms.</p>

    <h2>IMPORTANCE OF  ECOSYSTEM:- </h2>
    <img src="importance.jpg" alt="importance of ecosystem">
    <p><ul type="1">
      <li>It provides habitat to wild plants and animals. </li>
      <li>It promotes various food chains and food webs. </li>
      <li>It controls essential ecological processes and promotes lives.</li>
      <li> Involved in the recycling of nutrients between biotic and abiotic components.</li>
    </ul></p>
  </div>  
  <div class="content4">
    <h2>BIOTIC AND ABIOTIC :-</h2>
    <img src="biotic.jpeg" alt="BIOTIC AND ABIOTIC">
    <p>Biotic and abiotic factors are what make up ecosystems. Biotic factors are living things<br>
       within an ecosystem; such as plants, animals, and bacteria, while abiotic are non-living components;<br>
        such as water, soil and atmosphere. The way these components interact is critical in an ecosystem.<br></p>

      <p>All living organisms in our environment are called biotic resources. For example: trees animals insects etc.<br>
         Abiotic Resources – All non-living things present in our environment are termed as abiotic resources. For example –<br>
          earth air water metals rocks etc.</p>

    <h2>DESTROYING ECOSYSTEM : -</h2>
    <a href="#">  
      <img src="destr.jpg" alt="destructive ecosystem">
    </a>
    <p>Human activities like deforestation, pollution, overfishing, mining, etc., have resulted in destruction<br>
       of our ecosystem.Housing and feeding so many people has accelerated the destruction of natural habitats, <br>
       while higher levels of consumption, particularly in some richer parts of the world, have also increased the<br>
        exploitation of natural resources and led to growing levels of pollution.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the greatest of all threats to Earth's biodiversity is deforestation. While deforestation poses a threat<br>
         to ecosystems worldwide, it's especially devastating for tropical rainforests.</p>

      <div class="2nd-content7">
        <p>Pollutants such as sulphur can lead to excess levels of acid in lakes and streams, and damage trees and <br>
          forest soils; atmospheric nitrogen can reduce the biodiversity of plant communities and harm fish and other<br>
           aquatic life; ozone damages tree leaves and negatively affects scenic vistas in protected.</p>
        <p>Air pollution directly injures trees by damaging living tissue, primarily foliage, and impairs photosynthesis<br>
           and the ability to respirate. Air pollutants also weaken trees, predisposing them to further damage by insects and disease.</p>

    <h2>ECOSYSTEM AFFECTING FOOD CHAIN AND FOOD Web: </h2>
    <a href="#"><img src="food.png" alt="ecosystem affecting food chain"></a>
    <p>Food chains are important because they show the intricate relationships in ecosystems. They can reveal how each organism depends on someone else for survival. Food chains also display what happens when a problem occurs and a producer or consumer is lost. Entire communities can collapse.</p>
    <p>A healthy food web has an abundance of autotrophs, many herbivores, and relatively few carnivores and omnivores. This balance helps the ecosystem maintain and recycle biomass. Every link in a food web is connected to at least two others. The biomass of an ecosystem depends on how balanced and connected its food web .</p>

      <h3>ACTIONS DONE BY GOVERNAMENT FOR ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION:-</h3>
      <h5><a href="#" alt="ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION ACT(1986):-"></a></h5>
      <p>The main objectives of the Environment Protection Act, 1986 are to protect<br>
         and improve the quality of the environment, control and reduce pollution from<br>
          all sources, and ensure that environmental issues are taken into account in <br>
          decision-making processes. The act also aims to create public awareness about <br>
          environmental issues and promote sustainable development. Additionally, the act<br>
           provides for the establishment of authorities and procedures for the prevention<br>
            and control of environmental pollution.</p>
